 * rbtree.h - generic red-black tree declaration
 *
 * The red-black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree.
 * Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black"),
 * used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
 *
 * When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and recolored
 * to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced
 * the tree can become in the worst case.
 *
 * The rebalancing is not perfect, but guarantees searching in logarithmic time,
 * where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * The insertion and deletion, along with the tree rearranging and recoloring,
 * are also performed in logarithmic time.
 *
 * See https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1457&context=cstech for more details.
