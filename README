Index library
=============

This library is an in-memory implementation of five widely-used mappings for constructing efficient data index, i.e.,

  * AVL tree
  * Red-black tree
  * Left-leaning red-black tree
  * B-tree
  * B+-tree

There are several guides for users. Please read doc/README.rst first.

You need to have GNU Autotools installed on your machine before generating Makefile.
Run the following commands:

  $ autoreconf --install
  $ ./configure
  $ make

In order to install the Index library, use ``make install`` or to run tests, use ``make check``.

The Index library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1;
see COPYING for the full license text.
